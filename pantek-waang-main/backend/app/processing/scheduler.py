"""APScheduler wiring for periodic metric recomputation.

Rev 3 hardening (Agent 7):

* Symbols within a single scheduler tick are now processed concurrently via
  :func:`asyncio.gather` so a slow / failing symbol does not block the rest
  of the universe. Concurrency is bounded by a semaphore (default 4) so we
  don't stampede the DB connection pool.
* Every exception that escapes a tick coroutine is caught and logged — the
  scheduler thread is never allowed to die. Failed runs are also recorded
  in ``pipeline_runs`` (status='failed') by ``run_pipeline_for_symbol``
  itself.
