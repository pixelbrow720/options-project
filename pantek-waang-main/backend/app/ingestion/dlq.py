"""Dead-letter queue (DLQ) writer for ingestion failures.

Any ingester that drops a record because it cannot be parsed, has invalid
fields, or repeatedly fails to write should call :func:`record_dlq` so
operators can inspect the offending payload via `/admin/inspector/dlq`.

The DLQ writer is intentionally **best-effort**: a failure to persist to
the DLQ table is logged but never re-raised, so DLQ failures cannot
themselves crash the ingester. We also cap the in-memory queue depth
at :attr:`Settings.ingestion_dlq_max_size` so a runaway feed can't OOM
the process before the periodic flush lands.
