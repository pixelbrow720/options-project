"""Symmetric encryption helper for sensitive at-rest secrets.

The only thing this module is used for today is the Databento API key
pool (``databento_api_keys.api_key_encrypted``). We do not roll our own
crypto — we wrap :class:`cryptography.fernet.Fernet`, which is the
audited AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA-256 scheme from the ``cryptography``
library.

The Fernet key itself is derived deterministically from the application
``JWT_SECRET`` so we don't introduce a second piece of operator-managed
secret material. The derivation uses HKDF-SHA-256 with a fixed
application-specific salt and ``info`` label so:

* knowing ``JWT_SECRET`` always reproduces the same Fernet key (so the
  encrypted blobs in the DB stay readable after a restart), and
* the derived key is not the same as ``JWT_SECRET`` itself — leaking
  the encryption key does *not* leak the JWT signing key.

**Rotation note.** Today there is exactly one active derivation. If we
ever rotate ``JWT_SECRET`` we'll need a re-encryption job: read each
encrypted blob with the old derived key, write it back with the new
one. There's no in-place support for that yet — opening the door now
would be premature.
